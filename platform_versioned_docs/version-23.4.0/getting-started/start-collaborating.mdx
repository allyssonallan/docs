Before you get started with using Seqera Platform, you need to set up an organization. You'll then be able to add members, create teams, and invite external peers to collaborate with you.

## Organizations

Organizations are the top-level structure and contain workspaces, members, and teams. You can also add external collaborators to an organization. Visit the [organizations](../orgs-and-teams/organizations.mdx) page for more detailed information. 

## User workspaces

Each user has a unique personal workspace to manage resources such as pipelines, compute environments, and credentials. [Read more here](../orgs-and-teams/workspace-management.mdx). 

## Organization workspaces

You can create multiple workspaces within an organization context and associate each of these workspaces with dedicated teams of users, providing fine-grained access control for each team. See [Workspace management](../orgs-and-teams/workspace-management.mdx).
