# SSD storage

Fusion file system implements a lazy download and upload algorithm that runs in the background to transfer files in
parallel to and from the object storage into the container-local temporary directory (`/tmp`).

To achieve optimal performance it's recommended the use of SSD volume as temporary directory in the cluster computing
nodes and launch the Nextflow execution setting [scratch directive](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#scratch)
to `false` to avoid stage-out transfer time

Add the following snippet in your `nextflow.config` file to apply those settings:

```groovy
process.scratch = false
process.containerOptions = '-v /path/to/ssd:/tmp'
```

In the above snipped replace the path `/path/to/ssd` with the real path where the SSD volume has been mounted.

:::tip

      Several AWS EC2 instance types include one or more NVMe SSD volumes. Note, however those volumes
      need to be formatted to be used. See the [Amazon documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssd-instance-store.html) for details.
