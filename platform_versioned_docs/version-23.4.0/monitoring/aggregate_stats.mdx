## Aggregate stats

The **Aggregate stats** panel displays a real-time summary of the resources used by a pipeline run.

### Wall time

The _wall time_ is the duration of the entire workflow run, from submission to completion.

### CPU time

The _CPU time_ is the total CPU time used by all tasks. It is based on the CPUs _requested_, not the actual CPU usage. The CPU time of an individual task is computed as follows:

$$
\text{CPU time (CPU-hours)} = \text{Task CPUs} \times \text{Task runtime}
$$

The runtime of an individual task is computed as follows:

$$
\text{Task runtime} = \text{Task complete} - \text{Task start}
$$

See also: **cpus**, **start**, and **complete** in the task table.

### Total memory

The _total memory_ is the total memory used by all tasks. It is based on the memory _requested_, not the actual memory usage.

See also: **peakRss** in the task table.

### Read and write

The _read_ and _write_ are the total amount of data read from and written to storage.

See also: **readBytes** and **writeBytes** in the task table.

### Estimated cost

See [Cloud costs](./cloud-costs.mdx).

## Load

The **Load** panel displays the current number of running tasks and CPU cores vs the maximum number of tasks and CPU cores for the entire pipeline run. In the example below, there are 4 tasks with a total of 8 CPU cores currently running, and during the pipeline run there have been at most 7 tasks with 14 CPU cores running at one time.

These metrics measure the level of parallelism achieved by the pipeline. You can use these metrics to determine whether your pipeline runs are fully utilizing the capacity of your compute environment.

## Utilization

The **Utilization** panel displays the average resource utilization of all tasks that have completed successfully in a pipeline run. The CPU and memory efficiency of a task are computed as follows:

$$
\text{CPU efficiency (\%)} = \text{CPU usage (\%)} \times \text{Task CPUs}
$$

$$
\text{Memory efficiency (\%)} = \frac{ \text{Peak memory usage} }{ \text{Task memory} } \times \text{100 \%}
$$

See also: **pcpu**, **cpus**, **peakRss**, and **memory** in the task table.

These metrics measure how efficiently the pipeline is using its compute resources. Low utilization indicates that the pipeline might be requesting too many resources for some tasks.
