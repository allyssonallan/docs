Each Seqera Platform version makes use of `nf-launcher` to determine the Nextflow version used as its baseline. You can override this version with the `NXF_VER` environment variable during pipeline launch, but note that Seqera may not work reliably with Nextflow versions other than the baseline version.

Seqera officially supports the two latest major Platform releases (23.4.x, 23.3.x, etc.) at any given time.

| Platform version | nf-launcher version | Nextflow version | Fusion version |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| *                |                     | 24.04.2          | 2.3            |
| 23.4.4           | j17-23.10.1         | 23.10.1          | 2.2            |
| 23.4.3           | j17-23.10.1         | 23.10.1          | 2.2            |
| 23.4.2           | j17-23.10.1         | 23.10.1          | 2.2            |
| 23.4.1           | j17-23.10.1         | 23.10.1          | 2.2            |
| 23.4.0           | j17-23.04.3         | 23.04.3          | 2.1            |
| 23.3.0           | j17-23.04.3         | 23.04.3          | 2.1            |
| 23.3.0           | j17-23.04.3         | 23.04.3          | 2.1            |
| 23.2.0           | j17.23.04.2-up3     | 23.04.2          | 2.1            |
| 23.1.3           | j17-23.04.1         | 23.04.1          | 2.1            |

:::note 
Nextflow edge versions after 24.04.2 use Fusion 2.4 by default.

To use a Nextflow version other than the baseline in your pipeline run, use a [pre-run script](./launch/advanced#pre-and-post-run-scripts) during launch. For example, enter `export NXF_VER=24.04.2` in the **Pre-run script** field to take advantage of [new Nextflow features](https://nextflow.io/blog/2024/nextflow-2404-highlights.html) before a Platform version is released with 24.04.2 as its baseline. 

If no Nextflow version is specified in your configuration, Seqera defaults to the baseline version outlined above.
