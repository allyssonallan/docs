# Release notes for Seqera Enterprise version 24.1.0

Seqera Platform Enterprise version 24.1.0 introduces two new features: Data Explorer and Data Studios. A number of bug fixes and performance enhancements have also been included in this major release.

## Seqera Compute

Seqera Compute is a fully optimized runtime designed to revolutionize scientific computing on Seqera Platform. Now available in private preview, Seqera Compute enables scientists to concentrate on their work by integrating compute, storage, credential management, and performance optimizations into a single, cohesive service. 

## Data Studios

Data Studios is now publicly available for Seqera Cloud!

Data Studios closes the loop from development, to deployment and insights, allowing you to create, manage, share notebook environments in Seqera with the click of a button. It's now easier than ever to transition Nextflow-generated data to JupyterLab, RStudio, and VSCode environments with pre-built templates that can easily leverage existing Compute Environments and Data in Seqera Platform.

Data Studios also makes it seamless to work across teams with multi-user support, built-in authentication, and automatic snapshots as you work that enable collaboration and reproducibility while remaining secure.
Get inspired by examples running Data Studios, in the Seqera Platform Community Showcase. 

## Data Explorer

Data Explorer is now Generally Available and from version 24.1 it supports multi-file and multi-folder download. 

This allows users to bypass the need for cloud credentials or complex DevOps configurations and easily download entire datasets of pipeline results with to share with their team. This is a user-friendly alternative to traditional cloud storage services without the hassle of a command-line interface or intricate user interfaces.

## Extended data roles

## Micronaut v4

## Managed identities

### Other feature improvements

- OpenAPI support for Data Explorer
- Login configuration now includes the ability to remove email login
- Graviton3 EC2 instance families added as valid NVMe instances
- Retrieve reports from primary compute environment on Nextflow CLI runs
- Personal workspace updates (add)

## Breaking changes

< to be added >

## Upgrade steps

This version requires a database schema update. Follow these steps to update your DB instance and the Seqera installation.

:::caution
The database volume is persistent on the local machine by default if you use the `volumes` key in the `db` or `redis` section of your `docker-compose.yml` file to specify a local path to the DB or Redis instance. If your database is not persistent, you must back up your database before performing any application or database upgrades.
:::

To upgrade your database schema:

1. Make a backup of the Seqera Platform database. If you use the pipeline optimization service and your `groundswell` database resides in a database instance separate from your Seqera database, make a backup of your `groundswell` database as well.
2. Download the 24.1 versions of your deployment templates and update your Seqera container versions:
    - [docker-compose.yml](../_templates/docker/docker-compose.yml) for Docker Compose deployments
    - [tower-cron.yml](../_templates/k8s/tower-cron.yml) and [tower-svc.yml](../_templates/k8s/tower-svc.yml) for Kubernetes deployments
3. Restart the application.
4. If you're using a containerized database as part of your implementation:
    1. Stop the application.
    2. Upgrade the MySQL image.
    3. Restart the application.
5. If you're using Amazon RDS or other managed database services:
    1. Stop the application.
    2. Upgrade your database instance.
    3. Restart the application.
6. If you're using the pipeline optimization service (`groundswell` database) in a database separate from your Seqera database, update the MySQL image for your `groundswell` database instance while the application is down (during step 4 or 5 above). If you're using the same database instance for both, the `groundswell` update will happen automatically during the Seqera database update.

**Custom deployment**:

- Run the `/migrate-db.sh` script provided in the `migrate-db` container. This will migrate the database schema.
- Deploy Seqera following your usual procedures.

## Nextflow launcher image

If you must host your nf-launcher container image on a private image registry, copy the [nf-launcher image](https://quay.io/seqeralabs/nf-launcher:j17-24.04.2) to your private registry. Then update your `tower.env` with the launch container environment variable:

    `TOWER_LAUNCH_CONTAINER=<FULL_PATH_TO_YOUR_PRIVATE_IMAGE>`

:::caution
If you're using AWS Batch, you will need to [configure a custom job definition](../advanced-topics/custom-launch-container.mdx) and populate the `TOWER_LAUNCH_CONTAINER` with the job definition name instead.
