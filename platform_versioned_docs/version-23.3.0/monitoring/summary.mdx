## Task status

The **Status** panel provides a real-time status of all tasks in the pipeline run:

- **pending**: The task has been created, but not yet submitted to an executor
- **submitted**: The task has been submitted to an executor, but is not yet running
- **running**: The task has been launched by an executor (the precise definition of "running" may vary for each executor)
- **cached**: A previous (and valid) execution of the task was found and used instead of executing the task again
- **completed**: The task completed successfully
- **failed**: The task failed
