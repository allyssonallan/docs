Monitor cloud costs to manage resources effectively and prevent unexpected expenses when running pipelines in Seqera Platform. 

## Cloud provider cost monitoring and alerts

AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure provide cost alerting and budgeting tools to enable effective cloud resource management and prevent unexpected costs. 

### AWS 

- **Budgets**: [AWS Budgets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html) lets you set custom cost and usage budgets with alerts when costs or usage exceed pre-defined thresholds. Set up notifications via email or SNS (Simple Notification Service) to receive alerts when budget thresholds are reached.

- **Cost Explorer**: [AWS Cost Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/ce-what-is.html) provides cost management tools to visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.

- **Cost Anomaly Detection**: [AWS Cost Anomaly Detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/getting-started-ad.html) uses machine learning models to detect and alert on anomalous spend patterns in your deployed AWS services.

### Google Cloud 

- **Budgets and budget alerts**: [Budgets](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets) allow you to set budget thresholds for your GCP projects. When costs exceed these thresholds, you can receive alerts via email, SMS, or notifications in the Google Cloud Console.

- **Cost management tools**: [Cloud Billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/onboarding-checklist) provides cost management tools such as billing reports and spend visualization to help you analyze and understand your GCP costs.

### Microsoft Azure 

- **Cost Management**: [Microsoft Cost Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/overview-cost-management) is a suite of FinOps tools that help organizations analyze, monitor, and optimize their Microsoft Cloud costs. 

- **Cost alerts**: Create [alerts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/overview-cost-management#monitor-costs-with-alerts) for costs exceeding pre-defined thresholds or usage anomalies.
