When you view the details for a workflow run, you can investigate the run's **Tasks** and **Metrics** from their respective panels.

## Tasks

The **Tasks** panel shows all the tasks that were executed in a pipeline run.

### Search and filter tasks

Use the search bar to filter tasks by substrings in the table columns, such as **process**, **tag**, **hash**, and **status**. For example, if you enter `succeeded` in the **Search task** field, the table displays only tasks that succeeded.

### Task details

Select a task in the task table to open the **Task details** dialog. The dialog has two tabs: **About** and **Execution log**.

#### About

The **About** tab provides the following information:

- **Name**: Process name and tag

- **Command**: Task script, defined in the pipeline process

- **Status**: Exit code, task status, attempts

- **Work directory**: Directory where the task was executed

- **Environment**: Environment variables that were supplied to the task

- **Execution time**: Metrics for task submission, start, and completion time

- **Resources requested**: Metrics for the resources requested by the task

- **Resources used**: Metrics for the resources used by the task

#### Execution log

The **Execution log** tab provides a real-time log of the selected task's execution. Task execution and other logs (such as `stdout` and `stderr`) are available for download from here, if still available in your compute environment.

## Metrics

The **Metrics** panel displays interactive plots for CPU usage, memory usage, task duration, and I/O usage, grouped by process. Use these plots to quickly inspect a pipeline run to determine the resources requested and consumed by each process.
