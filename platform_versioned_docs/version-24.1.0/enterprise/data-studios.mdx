## Docker compose

This guide assumes that all services will be run in the same container as the rest of the platform services.

To run Data Studios in `docker compose` setup uncomment following values in the `_templates/docker/tower.env` file:

```dotenv
# Data Studios settings
TOWER_DATA_STUDIO_ALLOWED_WORKSPACES=<ALLOWED WORKSPACES>

# Enable Data Explorer to enable mounting data to your data studios
TOWER_DATA_EXPLORER_ENABLED=true
TOWER_DATA_EXPLORER_CLOUD_DISABLED_WORKSPACES=

TOWER_DATA_STUDIO_CONNECT_URL=<YOUR CONNECT URL, SAME AS `CONNECT_PROXY_URL` IN `data-studios.env` >
TOWER_OIDC_REGISTRATION_INITIAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR INITIAL ACCESS TOKEN, IDEANTICAL AS `INITIAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `data-studios.env`>
TOWER_OIDC_PEM_PATH=<PATH TO PEM FILE>
```

Fill in the values for `_templates/docker/data-studios.env` and uncomment the following lines in the `_templates/docker/docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
  connect-proxy:
    image: cr.seqera.io/private/nf-tower-enterprise/data-studio/tower-connect-proxy:0.6.14
    platform: linux/amd64
    env_file:
      - data-studios.env
    networks:
      - frontend
      - backend
    ports:
      - 9090:9090
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - redis

  connect-server:
    image: cr.seqera.io/private/nf-tower-enterprise/data-studio/tower-connect-server:v0.6.14
    platform: linux/amd64
    env_file:
      - data-studios.env
    networks:
      - backend
    ports:
      - 7070:7070
    restart: always
```

An RSA key is required for the Data Studios functionality. Generate your key and provide the path to it in the
`TOWER_OIDC_PEM_PATH` variable in the `data-studios.env` file. Next mount the `pem` file in the `backend` service in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

See this example in the configuration with `data-studios-rsa.pem` file mounted in the `backend` service:
```yaml
  backend:
    volumes:
      - $PWD/data-studios-rsa.pem:/data-studios-rsa.pem
```


## DNS setup

The proxy domain (`CONNECT_PROXY_URL`) has to be a subdomain of main platform domain (example: if the platform domain is
`tower.io`, then the proxy domain should be `example.tower.io`).
Data Studios requires a wildcard DNS record that will match requests for non-existent subdomains.
It is specified by a `*` as part of the domain name, example: `*.tower.io`. It should be pointed to the port 9090.

Example of setup:
```
*.tower.io -> 9090
tower.io -> 8000
```

Additionally, a valid wildcard ssl certificate to cover the third level domain is required.

:::note
We recommend using only a third-level domain if possible, as costs may increase with the number of subdomains.
