The **Processes** panel displays the status of each process in a pipeline run. In Nextflow, a _process_ is an individual step in a pipeline, while a _task_ is a particular invocation of a process for given input data. In the panel, each process is shown with a progress bar indicating how many tasks have been completed for that process.

The progress bar is color-coded based on task statuses (**created**, **submitted**, **completed**, **failed**).

Select a process to navigate to the [**Tasks**](./tasks.mdx#tasks) panel and filter the table contents by the selected process.
